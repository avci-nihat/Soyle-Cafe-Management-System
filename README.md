## Executive Summary

**Soyle** is a comprehensive SaaS solution designed to digitize the operational workflow of cafés and restaurants. Addressing the critical pain points of manual order taking, inventory inefficiencies, and kitchen communication errors, Soyle provides a seamless, QR-based ecosystem.

Unlike traditional POS systems requiring expensive proprietary hardware, Soyle operates on a **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** model with a cloud-native architecture, ensuring zero setup costs for venue owners and an app-free experience for customers.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

we implemented a Modular Monolith architecture. We didn't just build a web app; we engineered a high-performance operating system for restaurants. Our architectural choices were driven by the need for **low latency**, **high concurrency**, and **cost efficiency** during peak operational hours.

### Core Technology Stack
* **Backend:** Golang (Fiber Framework) – Selected for high concurrency and low-latency API responses.
* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite) – Delivers a reactive Single Page Application (SPA) experience.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon Tech) – Relational data integrity for financial transactions and inventory.
* **Real-Time Sync:** WebSocket Protocol – Powering the instant synchronization between Customer Orders and the Kitchen Display System (KDS).

### DevOps & Infrastructure
* **Containerization:** Fully Dockerized services ensuring consistency across Development and Production environments.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated GitHub Actions workflows that trigger parallel deployments to Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend) upon code push.
* **Security:** Enforced CORS policies, JWT Authentication, and strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

The ecosystem consists of **four** synchronized interfaces designed to cover every aspect of the operation:

### 1. Customer Experience (QR Web App)

* **Order Closure:** Close tables and finalize transactions with a single click.

### 3. Kitchen Display System (KDS)
* **Real-Time Workflow:** Orders appear instantly via WebSockets, prioritizing new items.
* **Status Updates:** Chefs can mark orders as "Prepared" or "Completed" to notify the staff.
* **Archive:** Access to past completed orders for kitchen efficiency analysis.

### 4. Admin & Operations Dashboard
* **Menu Management:** Add, edit, or delete products and prices in real-time.
